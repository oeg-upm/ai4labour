Our own experience or observations of others show that a “brilliant idea” can often lose its shine in the process of being turned into a story. Our course proposes a dual approach to the process of developing an idea and aims to provide a strong introduction to acquiring the practical and intellectual equipment necessary for this quest. The basic assumptions of the dual approach, which we consider to be causally connected, are: The fact that a dramatic idea is appealing to the individual who originated it, holds the key to making the idea appealing to others. Unfortunately, the answer to the question of what draws us and why, swiftly expands beyond the evident, beyond the field of consciousness and knowledge, to the gloomy and darker parts of our minds, in other words, to the unconscious. Everything that can attract us because of the powerful effects they have on us, takes its source from an area that we and others share in common, which we can call the collective unconscious. This collective unconscious constitutes a common \"human\" phenomenon and a common \"history of humanity\", which manifests itself in our consciousness as the diversity of very different cultures and, in particular, very different works of art. In our course, we first aim to introduce the basic concepts that will enable us to trace the attractiveness of an idea that can create powerful effects. Throughout the term, we want each student to build and develop a project in the context of their own dramatic ideas, in a practical confrontation with these powerful influences. Thus, it will be possible to obtain theoretical and practical equipment for an idea development process based on dual assumptions. It is planned to discuss a different concept every week in the first half of the class, to carry out a discussion supported by the weekly readings. As for the second part of the class, students will open their project ideas for a joint discussion which will help them to develop their ideas week by week. Although the general structure of the dramatic narrative (event, actor, unity, time, etc.) will be discussed in the context of the class, writing techniques will not be the primary focus of this course.","learning_outcomes":["1- With objective criteria, the ability to debate and evaluate why an idea is impressive. 2- To be able to decipher the mythical, archetypal, desire-related structures of the impressive elements in an idea. 3- To be able to transform the impressive elements into a plot."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000481","local_id":"30000481","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Visual Strategy Design in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000481/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000475","local_id":"30000475","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Film Grammar","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000475/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000482","local_id":"30000482","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Narrative and Narration in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000482/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30002238","local_id":"30002238","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Project","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30002238/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002439","local_id":"50002439","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Voice and Body Workshop","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002439/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002458","local_id":"50002458","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Building the Mise-en-scene in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002458/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002466","local_id":"50002466","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Turkish Modernization and Theater in Late Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002466/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002467","local_id":"50002467","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Freeing the Natural Voice","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002467/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30001044","local_id":"30001044","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Managerial Economics","lan":"","degree":"50258545","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30001044/program/50258545","contents":"Demand, Elasticity, Supply, Costs, Monopoply, Pricing; Strategic Thinking; Asymmetric Information","objective":"The purpose of this course is to teach, at a graduate level., managerial economics which is the science of directing scarce resources in the management of a business or other organization.

Please try to find theoretical or methodological questions instead of just clarification questions. You must consider the following points when preparing your TQs: (a) strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical perspective or empirical research, (b) theoretical implications of the (null) findings, (c) relevance to previous findings or personal observations, (d) potential future directions. Your TQs are due two days before each day of class. You will send the TQs to the corresponding week's discussion leader (see below) and cc' me to the email so that discussion leader can embed them into the discussion plan (e.g., in preparing that week's presentation), and so that I will grade the TQs independently. I will not grade the TQs that reach me after the due time. Supportive readings are optional, so you don’t have to read and provide questions about them (although I strongly encourage doing so) but the discussion leader(s) of the week should certainly read and briefly discuss when leading the class (see below). While sending TQs, please also send a brief summary for each article (3-6 sentences) of that week (except supporting readings). Discussion Leadership (DL): Each student is required to lead the class discussion at least once. DL will be done either individually or collaboratively in groups of 2 people depending on the difficulty of readings. The discussion leader(s) should briefly (15-20 mins) summarize the most important conceptual and methodological points in the main and optional readings respectively at the beginning of class to warm up the discussion. Then, s/he will lead the discussion based on previously selected TQs, and thus should combine them in a single document in order to use them in the discussion before class. The DL of that week should send me the ppt slides containing the main and optional readings 2 days before the class. In the remaining 2 days, DL is expected to deal with integrating submitted TQs into presentation. Grading for the DL will be determined by the quality of the presentation prepared and how well the DL has led the discussion during the lesson. Pre-registration: Each student is required to pre-register a research proposal at Open Science Framework (osf.io). Each of you will propose a replication attempt of a previous social psychological finding. You are free to choose the finding that you’ll propose to replicate. You can think of this as your midterm assignment. Proposal: Each student is required to prepare a full research proposal in a registered report format (full introduction, methods, references, and appendix). This proposal should be directly related to and extend the replication project you preregistered in your pre-registration assignment. (e.g., adding an extra condition as IV, additional DV as boundary conditions, strengthening the manipulation technique, increasing the sensitivity of DV, proposing a new underlying mechanism etc). You can think of this as your final assignment. Final exam: The final requirement is a final exam. Details TBA depending on the progress of the pandemic. In either case (in-class or online), the exam will be open-notes.","objective":"This M.A. level course aims to explore core social psychological concepts, theories, and phenomena related to human sociality from various perspectives: cognitive, social, behavioral, and evolutionary. The readings are selected mostly from the primary literature and will be made available in pdf format.

behavioral, and anthropological perspectives on human sociality, (3) have a good understanding of recent empirical and theoretical advances in social psychology such as open science revolution, intention-behavior discrepancy, theory crisis, and (4) have the ability to submit a preregistration protocol and proposal in registered report format.","learning_outcomes":["1- the students are
