Then we move to the post-classical theories/theoreticians of the what we may call postmodern times, particularly focusing the ways culture is problematized by scholars of political theory, anthropology, cultural studies, and so on. Finally, we will attend the theories and approaches, which has led to or been developed at the heels of the proliferation of culture almost to all walks of life.

What arguments have been used to legitimate and enforce these representations? How have these representations changed since the 19th century to the present?

We will also be concerned with the ways such taboos are naturalized and internalized, thus, circulating in the world as a norm by which everything else is measured. The seminar will challenge the discourse of normality, using examples from marginalized representations of the body in alternative cultural practices.

Our own experience or observations of others show that a “brilliant idea” can often lose its shine in the process of being turned into a story. Our course proposes a dual approach to the process of developing an idea and aims to provide a strong introduction to acquiring the practical and intellectual equipment necessary for this quest. The basic assumptions of the dual approach, which we consider to be causally connected, are: The fact that a dramatic idea is appealing to the individual who originated it, holds the key to making the idea appealing to others. Unfortunately, the answer to the question of what draws us and why, swiftly expands beyond the evident, beyond the field of consciousness and knowledge, to the gloomy and darker parts of our minds, in other words, to the unconscious. Everything that can attract us because of the powerful effects they have on us, takes its source from an area that we and others share in common, which we can call the collective unconscious. This collective unconscious constitutes a common \"human\" phenomenon and a common \"history of humanity\", which manifests itself in our consciousness as the diversity of very different cultures and, in particular, very different works of art. In our course, we first aim to introduce the basic concepts that will enable us to trace the attractiveness of an idea that can create powerful effects. Throughout the term, we want each student to build and develop a project in the context of their own dramatic ideas, in a practical confrontation with these powerful influences. Thus, it will be possible to obtain theoretical and practical equipment for an idea development process based on dual assumptions. It is planned to discuss a different concept every week in the first half of the class, to carry out a discussion supported by the weekly readings. As for the second part of the class, students will open their project ideas for a joint discussion which will help them to develop their ideas week by week. Although the general structure of the dramatic narrative (event, actor, unity, time, etc.) will be discussed in the context of the class, writing techniques will not be the primary focus of this course.","learning_outcomes":["1- With objective criteria, the ability to debate and evaluate why an idea is impressive. 2- To be able to decipher the mythical, archetypal, desire-related structures of the impressive elements in an idea. 3- To be able to transform the impressive elements into a plot."],"bloom":[0.2,0.4,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000481","local_id":"30000481","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Visual Strategy Design in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000481/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000475","local_id":"30000475","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Film Grammar","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000475/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30000482","local_id":"30000482","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Narrative and Narration in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258523","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30000482/program/50258523","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/30002238","local_id":"30002238","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Project","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/30002238/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002439","local_id":"50002439","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Voice and Body Workshop","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002439/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002458","local_id":"50002458","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Building the Mise-en-scene in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002458/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002466","local_id":"50002466","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Turkish Modernization and Theater in Late Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002466/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50002467","local_id":"50002467","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Freeing the Natural Voice","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50002467/program/50258524","contents":"","objective":"","learning_outcomes":[""],"bloom":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+%C3%9Cniversitesi/50001364","local_id":"50001364","institution":"Kadir Has Üniversitesi","title":"Historical Sources and Methods of Research","lan":"","degree":"50258527","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/pdf/50001364/program/50258527","contents":"The need and importance of historic research, defining the topic and its limits.

Please try to find theoretical or methodological questions instead of just clarification questions. You must consider the following points when preparing your TQs: (a) strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical perspective or empirical research, (b) theoretical implications of the (null) findings, (c) relevance to previous findings or personal observations, (d) potential future directions. Your TQs are due two days before each day of class. You will send the TQs to the corresponding week's discussion leader (see below) and cc' me to the email so that discussion leader can embed them into the discussion plan (e.g., in preparing that week's presentation), and so that I will grade the TQs independently. I will not grade the TQs that reach me after the due time. Supportive readings are optional, so you don’t have to read and provide questions about them (although I strongly encourage doing so) but the discussion leader(s) of the week should certainly read and briefly discuss when leading the class (see below). While sending TQs, please also send a brief summary for each article (3-6 sentences) of that week (except supporting readings). Discussion Leadership (DL): Each student is required to lead the class discussion at least once. DL will be done either individually or collaboratively in groups of 2 people depending on the difficulty of readings. The discussion leader(s) should briefly (15-20 mins) summarize the most important conceptual and methodological points in the main and optional readings respectively at the beginning of class to warm up the discussion. Then, s/he will lead the discussion based on previously selected TQs, and thus should combine them in a single document in order to use them in the discussion before class. The DL of that week should send me the ppt slides containing the main and optional readings 2 days before the class. In the remaining 2 days, DL is expected to deal with integrating submitted TQs into presentation. Grading for the DL will be determined by the quality of the presentation prepared and how well the DL has led the discussion during the lesson. Pre-registration: Each student is required to pre-register a research proposal at Open Science Framework (osf.io). Each of you will propose a replication attempt of a previous social psychological finding. You are free to choose the finding that you’ll propose to replicate. You can think of this as your midterm assignment. Proposal: Each student is required to prepare a full research proposal in a registered report format (full introduction, methods, references, and appendix). This proposal should be directly related to and extend the replication project you preregistered in your pre-registration assignment. (e.g., adding an extra condition as IV, additional DV as boundary conditions, strengthening the manipulation technique, increasing the sensitivity of DV, proposing a new underlying mechanism etc). You can think of this as your final assignment. Final exam: The final requirement is a final exam. Details TBA depending on the progress of the pandemic. In either case (in-class or online), the exam will be open-notes.","objective":"This M.A. level course aims to explore core social psychological concepts, theories, and phenomena related to human sociality from various perspectives: cognitive, social, behavioral, and evolutionary.

Por otra parte se considera a la empresa dentro de\r\nsu ambiente económico, con el que se interrelaciona y comunica con las otras unidades económicas que\r\nconfiguran su ambiente o mundo exterior, sin olvidar el marco social e institucional. De su relación con este\r\nentorno la empresa obtiene los recursos que precisa para realizar sus actividades, que son las que finalmente le\r\npermiten lograr sus objetivos. \r\nLa asignatura concibe la empresa dentro de un sistema de producción en una economía de mercado, donde es\r\néste el que determina qué mercancías, en qué cantidad, cómo y para quién producirlas. Se reconoce el papel\r\nsocial de la empresa como remuneradora de los factores de producción y anticipadora de rentas individuales.\r\nTampoco se olvida su valor social como protagonista en última instancia de la satisfacción del consumidor y de la\r\nsociedad en su conjunto a través del consumo de los bienes y servicios que las empresas producen.

Esta asignatura se centra principalmente en métodos basados en\r\nredes de neuronas artificiales y en métodos de aprendizaje de modelos probabilísticos.\r\nDentro del enfoque basado en redes de neuronas artificiales, se presentan métodos de aprendizaje profundo y\r\naprendizaje por refuerzo.

En esta parte, se\r\npresenta en primer lugar una introducción con fundamentos de aprendizaje en este campo (por ejemplo,\r\nconceptos básicos de probabilidad multivariante, clasificación y regresión probabilística, etc.) y tras ello se\r\npresenta el modelo naive Bayes. Después, se describen métodos de aprendizaje de redes bayesianas, un\r\nformalismo que permite representar y hacer inferencia con distribuciones de probabilidad sobre múltiples variables\r\nmediante el uso de independencias condicionales.

En la mayor parte de las situaciones, los fenómenos a estudiar pueden describirse mediante ecuaciones\r\ndiferenciales, una potente herramienta matemática que ayuda a modelar situaciones en las que se producen\r\ncambios en función del tiempo (o alguna otra magnitud de interés en el estudio).

Así, es posible\r\nrealizar, por ejemplo, resolución numérica de ecuaciones diferenciales mediante técnicas basadas en redes\r\nneuronales propias del Deep Learning y realizar ajuste de parámetros en los modelos de ecuaciones diferenciales\r\nque permitan después obtener conclusiones cuando se complementa este trabajo con el estudio teórico de los\r\nmodelos.\r\nLa asignatura \"Ecuaciones Diferenciales y Modelización de Fenómenos Reales\" pretende ofrecer a los\r\nestudiantes una introducción al modelado de fenómenos reales mediante ecuaciones diferenciales ordinarias y\r\nsistemas de ecuaciones diferenciales, así como proporcionarles herramientas básicas que les permitan analizar\r\nmatemáticamente los modelos obtenidos, interpretando los resultados y obteniendo conclusiones. Además,\r\ntambién se pretende presentar diferentes métodos numéricos que permitan realizar simulaciones de los modelos,\r\ncomplementando así el estudio teórico previo.\r\nComenzaremos el primer tema con una introducción a la teoría básica de ecuaciones diferenciales, centrándonos\r\nen el concepto de solución, los problemas de valores iniciales y la existencia y unicidad de solución local de los\r\nmismos. Pasaremos después a estudiar condiciones bajo las cuales la solución local es, en realidad, global.\r\nAdemás, relacionaremos el concepto de derivada con el de ecuación diferencial y mostraremos que gran parte de\r\nlos fenómenos que tienen lugar en la vida real pueden modelarse mediante ecuaciones diferenciales.\r\nEstudiaremos entonces las ecuaciones diferenciales más simples, las de primer orden, así como algunos métodos\r\nde resolución de las mismas, además de hacer una introducción al modelado de fenómenos reales con tal tipo de\r\necuaciones.\r\nPosteriormente continuaremos estudiando ecuaciones diferenciales de orden superior. Tras introducir la teoría\r\nbásica acerca de este tipo de ecuaciones diferenciales, donde trataremos el sistema fundamental de soluciones o\r\nel principio de superposición, nos centraremos en las ecuaciones diferenciales de orden superior lineales de\r\ncoeficientes constantes, homogéneas y no homogéneas, así como algunos métodos que ayudan a resolverlas\r\ncomo el de variación de parámetros. En este caso ilustraremos los conceptos teóricos con numerosos ejemplos de\r\nla vida real que pueden ser modelados por este tipo de ecuaciones diferenciales.\r\nMás adelante consideraremos sistemas diferenciales lineales de primer orden. En este caso haremos una\r\nintroducción teórica para presentar de nuevo el sistema fundamental de soluciones y el principio de superposición\r\nen el caso en el que trabajamos con sistemas y estudiaremos cómo resolver dos grandes tipos de sistemas\r\ndiferenciales lineales, homogéneos y no homogéneos. Ilustraremos también en este caso el marco teórico con\r\nnumerosos ejemplos para que pueda entenderse bien la forma en la que podemos modelar fenómenos reales\r\nmediante sistemas lineales.\r\nUna vez llegados a este punto, nos centraremos en el estudio de sistemas diferenciales no lineales de primer\r\nGA_10CD_105001050\r\n1S_2023-24\r\nEcuaciones Diferenciales Y Modelización De Fenómenos Reales\r\nGrado En Ciencia De Datos E Inteligencia Artificial\r\nPágina 4 de 14\r\nPR/CL/001\r\nPROCESO DE COORDINACIÓN DE\r\nLAS ENSEÑANZAS\r\nANX-PR/CL/001-01\r\nGUÍA DE APRENDIZAJE\r\nE.T.S. de Ingenieros\r\nInformaticos\r\norden. A diferencia de los lineales, en este caso no contamos con una teoría general tan amplia que nos permita\r\nencontrar soluciones explícitas. Sin embargo, presentaremos algunos sencillos ingredientes como los conceptos\r\nde órbita, plano de fases, punto de equilibrio y estabilidad, que nos ayudarán a tener información cualitativa de los\r\nsistemas con los que trabajemos, a pesar de no ser capaces de encontrar soluciones explícitas de los mismos. En\r\nparticular, haremos una introducción a la teoría de estabilidad local de los puntos de equilibrio y a la linealización.\r\nDe nuevo, numerosos ejemplos de gran interés motivarán el estudio de este tema.\r\nFinalmente se presentarán diferentes métodos de diferencias finitas para llevar a cabo la resolución numérica de\r\necuaciones y sistemas diferenciales, haciendo un breve análisis del orden y de los errores cometidos en cada uno\r\nde los métodos e implementando tales métodos en algún software matemático. Esto permitirá a los estudiantes\r\ncomplementar la formación en los temas precedentes, así como proveerles de una potente herramienta que puede\r\nayudarles a proporcionar información detallada acerca del fenómeno en estudio.\r\n5.","learning_outcomes":["","RA134 - Modelar matemáticamente problemas reales mediante ecuaciones diferenciales o sistemas diferenciales","RA135 - Conocer técnicas para resolver algunos tipos de ecuaciones diferenciales y sistemas diferenciales","lineales.","RA136 - Saber realizar un estudio cualitativo de sistemas diferenciales no lineales.","RA138 - Dominar diferentes métodos numéricos de diferencias finitas y su programación para estudiar problemas","de la vida real descritos mediante ecuaciones o sistemas diferenciales.","RA133 - Entender la importancia de las ecuaciones diferenciales y su utilidad para modelar fenómenos de la vida","real.","5.

Uno de los cambios más relevantes y que\r\nmayor atención está recibiendo es la aproximación orientada a servicios al desarrollo de software y sistemas. La\r\narquitectura orientada a servicios (SOA, del inglés Service Oriented Architecture) facilita la concepción y el diseño\r\nde sistemas distribuidos a gran escala construidos a partir de servicios ofrecidos y controlados posiblemente por\r\ndiferentes empresas, en un entorno abierto de Internet.

En este proceso, el modelado de tales fenómenos es clave, así como lo es el\r\nconocimiento de diferentes técnicas y herramientas matemáticas que permitan abordar su estudio.

Una vez\r\ndeducida la ecuación, se presentará el método de separación de variables, así como algunos resultados de\r\nconvergencia de series de Fourier que serán de vital importancia para encontrar la solución explícita de la\r\necuación en estudio. Estudiaremos también resultados de unicidad de solución y el efecto regularizante que posee\r\nla ecuación del calor. Además, se introducirá el uso de la transformada de Fourier y su aplicación a la resolución\r\nde la ecuación del calor unidimensional con dominio temporal no acotado.\r\nPosteriormente continuaremos con las ecuaciones hiperbólicas, centrándonos en la ecuación de ondas\r\nunidimensional. En este caso, tras deducir la ecuación, presentaremos la Fórmula de D'Alembert, que permitirá\r\nresolver de forma explícita el problema de Cauchy para la ecuación de ondas, así como un resultado de unicidad\r\nde solución. Además, se estudiará el problema de Cauchy-Dirichlet para la ecuación de ondas por medio del\r\nmétodo de las características y resultados de unicidad de solución. Finalizaremos este tema tratando la\r\necuación de ondas no homogénea, para la cual haremos uso del principio de Duhamel.\r\nMás adelante consideraremos el último gran tipo de ecuaciones en derivadas parciales de segundo orden, las\r\nelípticas, donde abordaremos la ecuación de Laplace y la de Poisson. En este caso introduciremos el operador\r\nlaplaciano y diferentes resultados teóricos que serán clave para abordar el resto del tema, como las Identidades\r\nde Green y el Principio del Máximo. Estudiaremos la solución fundamental de la ecuación de Laplace, así como la\r\nfórmula de representación de Green, la función de Green y la fórmula integral de Poisson, herramientas que nos\r\npermitirán resolver el problema de Dirichlet para la ecuación de Laplace en una bola. Después consideraremos el\r\nproblema de Dirichlet para la ecuación de Poisson, introduciendo para ello el potencial newtoniano. Finalizaremos\r\neste tema estudiando cómo obtener la función de Green en dominios con simetría.\r\nFinalmente, se tratarán métodos de diferencias finitas para la resolución numérica de ecuaciones en derivadas\r\nparciales, implementando tales métodos en algún software matemático. Esto permitirá a los estudiantes\r\ncomplementar el estudio teórico realizado en los temas precedentes, así como proveerles de una potente\r\nherramienta que puede ayudarles a proporcionar información detallada acerca del fenómeno en estudio.\r\nGA_10ML_105000161\r\n1S_2023-24\r\nEcuaciones En Derivadas Parciales Y Simulación Numérica\r\nGrado En Matematicas E Informática\r\nPágina 4 de 13\r\nPR/CL/001\r\nPROCESO DE COORDINACIÓN DE\r\nLAS ENSEÑANZAS\r\nANX-PR/CL/001-01\r\nGUÍA DE APRENDIZAJE\r\nE.T.S. de Ingenieros\r\nInformaticos\r\n5.","learning_outcomes":["","RA192 - Manejo de software matemático que ayude a resolver numéricamente problemas de la vida real descritos","mediante ecuaciones en derivadas parciales","RA193 - Modelizar matemáticamente problemas de la vida real mediante ecuaciones en derivadas parciales y","conocer las técnicas para resolverlos.","RA75 - Estudiar fenómenos o situaciones del mundo real en los que se apliquen las Matemáticas de manera","esencial","RA111 - Dado un campo de aplicación de las matemáticas o de la informática, evaluar y diseñar la solución más","apropiada para resolver alguno de sus problemas, exponiendo las dificultades técnicas y los limites de la","aplicación","RA76 - Conocer las herramientas básicas para la formulación de modelos físico-matemáticos en ciencias e","ingeniería.","RA103 - Conocer alguno de los campos situados en la frontera entre las matemáticas y la informática, que están","en la base de nuevas tendencias y desarrollos.","RA50 - Utilizar diversas técnicas para la resolución de problemas con ayuda de software matemático.","5.

En ella se ofrece tanto un enfoque conceptual como evolutivo de la empresa, que\r\npermite observarla y analizarla tal y como se presenta hoy día. Por otra parte se considera a la empresa dentro de\r\nsu ambiente económico, con el que se interrelaciona y comunica con las otras unidades económicas que\r\nconfiguran su ambiente o mundo exterior, sin olvidar el marco social e institucional. De su relación con este\r\nentorno la empresa obtiene los recursos que precisa para realizar sus actividades, que son las que finalmente le\r\npermiten lograr sus objetivos. \r\nLa asignatura concibe la empresa dentro de un sistema de producción en una economía de mercado, donde es\r\néste el que determina qué mercancías, en qué cantidad, cómo y para quién producirlas. Se reconoce el papel\r\nsocial de la empresa como remuneradora de los factores de producción y anticipadora de rentas individuales.\r\nTampoco se olvida su valor social como protagonista en última instancia de la satisfacción del consumidor y de la\r\nsociedad en su conjunto a través del consumo de los bienes y servicios que las empresas producen. Por último se\r\ndestaca el papel fundamental de la empresa en el ciclo económico-financiero a través del ahorro de las rentas que\r\nobtiene y su aplicación posterior como inversión, que permite la expansión, regeneración y continuidad del sistema\r\neconómico-financiero.\r\nLa redacción de los distintos temas que configuran el programa pretende ser a la vez teórica y práctica. Los\r\nprimeros temas quieren ser una aproximación breve a los conceptos más básicos de la Economía General y de la\r\nEconomía de la Empresa. Según se avanza en el temario se introducen los temas cuyo interés se centra en la\r\nAdministración de Empresas: Planificación, Organización, Dirección y Control. No se olvida un enfoque funcional\r\nde la empresa en su forma más clásica centrado en los sistemas clásicos: producción, financiación y\r\ncomercialización.\r\nGA_10ML_105000378\r\n2S_2023-24\r\nFundamentos De Economía Y Administración De Empresas\r\nGrado En Matematicas E Informática\r\nPágina 4 de 14\r\nPR/CL/001\r\nPROCESO DE COORDINACIÓN DE\r\nLAS ENSEÑANZAS\r\nANX-PR/CL/001-01\r\nGUÍA DE APRENDIZAJE\r\nE.T.S. de Ingenieros\r\nInformaticos\r\n4.","learning_outcomes":["","RA119 - Utilizar técnicas de análisis de mercados, identificar necesidades de productos y servicios dentro de un","marco de innovación tecnológica y generación de ideas que permitan la innovación.","RA120 - Identificar, planificar, seguir y evaluar las acciones necesarias para definir y alcanzar un objetivo dentro","de una estrategia empresarial.","RA118 - Aplicar técnicas de presupuestos en el marco de un plan de negocio.","RA117 - Identificar y describir las tareas funcionales de una empresa y sus responsabilidades.","RA121 - Capacidad para identificar y asegurar el cumplimiento de los valores y principios éticos, legales,","democráticos, de igualdad y derechos fundamentales dentro de una organización.","GA_10ML_105000378","2S_2023-24","Fundamentos De Economía Y Administración De Empresas","Grado En Matematicas E Informática","Página 3 de 14","PR/CL/001","PROCESO DE COORDINACIÓN DE","LAS ENSEÑANZAS","ANX-PR/CL/001-01","GUÍA DE APRENDIZAJE","E.T.S. de Ingenieros","Informaticos","4.

Para entenderlo,\r\nutilizaremos técnicas de la teoría de grafos y nociones de teoría de grupos para manejar diversos tipos de\r\noperadores. Estudiaremos, además, números muy presentes en matemática: los números de Catalan.\r\nVeremos que, no solamente poseen varias interpretaciones combinatorias (triangulaciones de polígonos, caminos\r\nde Dyck, árboles binarios completos, etc) sino que también aparecen en problemas de particiones;\r\naprovecharemos para tratar problemas de ordenamiento mediante el estudio de ciertos tipos de permutaciones.\r\nDentro de las técnicas abordadas en esta asignatura, haremos hincapié en las funciones generatrices, es decir,\r\nseries de potencias cuyos coeficientes son diseñados para contener la información deseada.\r\nResultan ser una herramienta algebraica muy potente para resolver problemas combinatorios.
