Our own experience or observations of others show that a “brilliant idea” can often lose its shine in the process of being turned into a story. Our course proposes a dual approach to the process of developing an idea and aims to provide a strong introduction to acquiring the practical and intellectual equipment necessary for this quest. The basic assumptions of the dual approach, which we consider to be causally connected, are: The fact that a dramatic idea is appealing to the individual who originated it, holds the key to making the idea appealing to others. Unfortunately, the answer to the question of what draws us and why, swiftly expands beyond the evident, beyond the field of consciousness and knowledge, to the gloomy and darker parts of our minds, in other words, to the unconscious. Everything that can attract us because of the powerful effects they have on us, takes its source from an area that we and others share in common, which we can call the collective unconscious. This collective unconscious constitutes a common \"human\" phenomenon and a common \"history of humanity\", which manifests itself in our consciousness as the diversity of very different cultures and, in particular, very different works of art. In our course, we first aim to introduce the basic concepts that will enable us to trace the attractiveness of an idea that can create powerful effects. Throughout the term, we want each student to build and develop a project in the context of their own dramatic ideas, in a practical confrontation with these powerful influences. Thus, it will be possible to obtain theoretical and practical equipment for an idea development process based on dual assumptions. It is planned to discuss a different concept every week in the first half of the class, to carry out a discussion supported by the weekly readings. As for the second part of the class, students will open their project ideas for a joint discussion which will help them to develop their ideas week by week. Although the general structure of the dramatic narrative (event, actor, unity, time, etc.) will be discussed in the context of the class, writing techniques will not be the primary focus of this course.","learning_outcomes":["In addition to the discussion and development of each student's own idea, the following themes will be discussed week by week in light of source readings: MEANING, NATURE, SACRED, ARCHETYPES, CAUSALITY, DEATH, PRIVATE, PUBLIC AND COSMIC TIME, TRANSFERING TIME AND SPACE - ECSTASY, HUMAN and ANIMAL, MONSTER - BODY, GENDER and SEXUALITY, CAPTURING

Our own experience or observations of others show that a “brilliant idea” can often lose its shine in the process of being turned into a story. Our course proposes a dual approach to the process of developing an idea and aims to provide a strong introduction to acquiring the practical and intellectual equipment necessary for this quest. The basic assumptions of the dual approach, which we consider to be causally connected, are: The fact that a dramatic idea is appealing to the individual who originated it, holds the key to making the idea appealing to others. Unfortunately, the answer to the question of what draws us and why, swiftly expands beyond the evident, beyond the field of consciousness and knowledge, to the gloomy and darker parts of our minds, in other words, to the unconscious. Everything that can attract us because of the powerful effects they have on us, takes its source from an area that we and others share in common, which we can call the collective unconscious. This collective unconscious constitutes a common \"human\" phenomenon and a common \"history of humanity\", which manifests itself in our consciousness as the diversity of very different cultures and, in particular, very different works of art. In our course, we first aim to introduce the basic concepts that will enable us to trace the attractiveness of an idea that can create powerful effects. Throughout the term, we want each student to build and develop a project in the context of their own dramatic ideas, in a practical confrontation with these powerful influences. Thus, it will be possible to obtain theoretical and practical equipment for an idea development process based on dual assumptions. It is planned to discuss a different concept every week in the first half of the class, to carry out a discussion supported by the weekly readings. As for the second part of the class, students will open their project ideas for a joint discussion which will help them to develop their ideas week by week. Although the general structure of the dramatic narrative (event, actor, unity, time, etc.) will be discussed in the context of the class, writing techniques will not be the primary focus of this course.","learning_outcomes":["In addition to the discussion and development of each student's own idea, the following themes will be discussed week by week in light of source readings: MEANING, NATURE, SACRED, ARCHETYPES, CAUSALITY, DEATH, PRIVATE, PUBLIC AND COSMIC TIME, TRANSFERING TIME AND SPACE - ECSTASY, HUMAN and ANIMAL, MONSTER - BODY, GENDER and SEXUALITY, CAPTURING DESIRE"]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30000481","local_id":"30000481","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Visual Strategy Design in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30000481/program/50258524","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/50002466","local_id":"50002466","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Turkish Modernization and Theater in Late Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/50002466/program/50258524","contents":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/50002467","local_id":"50002467","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Freeing the Natural Voice","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/50002467/program/50258524","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30000475","local_id":"30000475","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Film Grammar","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30000475/program/50258524","contents":"","learning_outcomes":["1- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 2- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş. 3- bu alanın çevirisi henüz girilmemiş."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30000482","local_id":"30000482","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Narrative and Narration in Film","lan":"","degree":"50258524","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30000482/program/50258524","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002239","local_id":"30002239","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Research Methods","lan":"","degree":"50258545","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002239/program/50258545","contents":"This course aims to introduce essential issues in epistemology, research design and methodological choices in social science research to graduate students.

In this course, we will explore this question in the light of canonical texts and emerging voices in the transdisciplinary field of performance studies. Performance studies began to develop as a field in the 1960s at the intersection of theater, anthropology, and philosophy of language. Using performance as a lens to study diverse realms of society, scholars in the field challenge the illusion of “naturalness” that often defines our conceptions of everyday life. Instead, the performance studies paradigm allows us to explore how social order is scripted and invented, and how social and political categories and identities become normalized through continuous repetition. Our emphasis on performance and performativity will help us develop a critical understanding of the politics of everyday life and the intertwined operations of power on the global and individual level as well as the ramifications of these dynamics on the politics of subjectivity and belonging.

Then, the course will examine the theoretical background of the dominant tension within the relation between the individual and the political organization of modern society: the state. After addressing possibilities and improvements of the liberal theory of rights that substantially supports today’s human rights discourse, a discussion on its dilemmas and boundaries will be held. As constructing this critical approach, we will especially refer to feminist theory, queer theory, and Marxist theory. And then, to go beyond the dilemmas and limits discussed, Spinoza’s theory of conatus and his approach on passions will be suggested as a method for discussion within the frame of relevant reading materials. Finally, we will give examples that constrain modern theory of rights theoretically, focusing on new movements that differ from mainstream struggles for rights and their new conceptualizations."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002113","local_id":"30002113","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Current Issues of Criminal Law","lan":"","degree":"50258384","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002113/program/50258384","contents":"In lectures, studies on criminal law are performed.

In this way, the accuracy of the structural models produced using existing computational techniques can be tested, together with the examination of high complexity systems. Within the scope of this course, students will examine recent studies that exemplify how the use of integrative and/or knowledge-oriented approaches and platforms can produce highly accurate structural models. Students will be asked to present their own research within the scope of the course, and solutions will be proposed by discussing how to solve their own research problems."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/50002335","local_id":"50002335","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/50002335/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002259","local_id":"30002259","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002259/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002356","local_id":"30002356","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Probability and Stochastic Processes","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002356/program/50366239","contents":"Review of probability concepts and random variables.

Subsequently we will move on to a select set of advanced topics in networking, primarily at recent and ongoing advances in \"the edges\" of the Internet.","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30001413","local_id":"30001413","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30001413/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002379","local_id":"30002379","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Special Topics in Electronics Engineering II","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002379/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/50001478","local_id":"50001478","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/50001478/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002267","local_id":"30002267","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002267/program/50366239","contents":"","learning_outcomes":[""]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30002380","local_id":"30002380","institution":"Kadir Has University","title":"Financial Mathematics I","lan":"","degree":"50366239","link":"https://bologna.khas.edu.tr/ders/30002380/program/50366239","contents":"Basic mathematical functions.

After addressing possibilities and improvements of the liberal theory of rights that substantially supports today’s human rights discourse, a discussion on its dilemmas and boundaries will be held. As constructing this critical approach, we will especially refer to feminist theory, queer theory, and Marxist theory. And then, to go beyond the dilemmas and limits discussed, Spinoza’s theory of conatus and his approach on passions will be suggested as a method for discussion within the frame of relevant reading materials.

The readings are selected mostly from the primary literature and will be made available in pdf format. At the end of this course, the students are expected to (1) acquire a critical perspective on contemporary social psychology, (2) understand evolutionary, cognitive, individual differences, behavioral, and anthropological perspectives on human sociality, (3) have a good understanding of recent empirical and theoretical advances in social psychology such as open science revolution, intention-behavior discrepancy, theory crisis, and (4) have the ability to submit a preregistration protocol and proposal in registered report format.","learning_outcomes":["Thought Questions/Comments (TQ): Each week (except first week), each student is required to prepare two TQs or comments to enrich the discussion. Please try to find theoretical or methodological questions instead of just clarification questions. You must consider the following points when preparing your TQs: (a) strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical perspective or empirical research, (b) theoretical implications of the (null) findings, (c) relevance to previous findings or personal observations, (d) potential future directions. Your TQs are due two days before each day of class. You will send the TQs to the corresponding week's discussion leader (see below) and cc' me to the email so that discussion leader can embed them into the discussion plan (e.g., in preparing that week's presentation), and so that I will grade the TQs independently. I will not grade the TQs that reach me after the due time. Supportive readings are optional, so you don’t have to read and provide questions about them (although I strongly encourage doing so) but the discussion leader(s) of the week should certainly read and briefly discuss when leading the class (see below). While sending TQs, please also send a brief summary for each article (3-6 sentences) of that week (except supporting readings). Discussion Leadership (DL): Each student is required to lead the class discussion at least once. DL will be done either individually or collaboratively in groups of 2 people depending on the difficulty of readings. The discussion leader(s) should briefly (15-20 mins) summarize the most important conceptual and methodological points in the main and optional readings respectively at the beginning of class to warm up the discussion. Then, s/he will lead the discussion based on previously selected TQs, and thus should combine them in a single document in order to use them in the discussion before class. The DL of that week should send me the ppt slides containing the main and optional readings 2 days before the class. In the remaining 2 days, DL is expected to deal with integrating submitted TQs into presentation. Grading for the DL will be determined by the quality of the presentation prepared and how well the DL has led the discussion during the lesson. Pre-registration: Each student is required to pre-register a research proposal at Open Science Framework (osf.io). Each of you will propose a replication attempt of a previous social psychological finding. You are free to choose the finding that you’ll propose to replicate. You can think of this as your midterm assignment. Proposal: Each student is required to prepare a full research proposal in a registered report format (full introduction, methods, references, and appendix). This proposal should be directly related to and extend the replication project you preregistered in your pre-registration assignment. (e.g., adding an extra condition as IV, additional DV as boundary conditions, strengthening the manipulation technique, increasing the sensitivity of DV, proposing a new underlying mechanism etc). You can think of this as your final assignment. Final exam: The final requirement is a final exam. Details TBA depending on the progress of the pandemic. In either case (in-class or online), the exam will be open-notes."]},{"id":"http://ai4labour.linkeddata.es/data/course/Kadir+Has+University/30001110","local_id":"30001110","institution":"Kadir Has
